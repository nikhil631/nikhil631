# Welcome To my Profile
:wave: Hello, My name is Nikhil Kumar Tomar, I generally define myself as simple Computer Enthusiast :nerd_face:<br/>
I just like all the things Computers have to offer, The greatest thing I find myself doing is spending hours and hours on PC and not getting tired whatsoever, this is one ability that I am thankful that I have.<br/><br/>

# Hobbies
I mainly do not have many hobbies except learning new technologies about Computers.<br/> I have experienced many fields you name it, Hacking, Managing-Servers, Deploying Docker Containers or Deploying Kubernetes clusters, Making Websites, Automating Tasks and much more.<br/>
From all the above things, even I can say that I am interested in backend side of various businesses.

# Favorite Languages
I don't have many favorite languages, The Majority of times I find myself using Python for most of my Projects.<br/> I know many modules in Python from Os, Sys to Paramiko, Fabric, Pandas, you name it.<br/><br/>
I absolutely love Structured Query Language or SQL, I have built various Python projects around it so entering data in the database doesn't take too much effort and code, It's automated way of doing things.<br/><br/>
Furthermore, I also know C++ Basics and have build various scripts for basic tasks as well.
Apart from this I know Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and a bit of Bash.
